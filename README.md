## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. 
Run `rake test` to run the tests. 
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

This repo uses rufo and rubocop for formatting and style enforcement.
To install rufo globally, run `gem install rufo`. You can then run `rufo .` to format all files in the directory. There are various plugins for text editors - for vs-code we recommend [vscode-rufo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mbessey.vscode-rufo)
